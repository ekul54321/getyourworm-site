    <h2> Terms & Conditions</h2>
    <p><em>Last updated: June 2025</em></p>

    <h3>1. Who we are</h3>
    <p>GetYourWorm is a site built to help 20-somethings answer key financial questions with tools, projections, and simplified insights. We’re not financial advisers — just a team trying to help early birds get their worm.</p>

    <h3>2. What we do (and what we don’t)</h3>
    <p>The content, calculators, and tools on this site are for general information only. Nothing on this site is intended as financial advice, personal recommendations, or investment guidance.</p>
    <p>You’re responsible for your own decisions — please do your own research or seek professional advice where needed.</p>

    <h3>3. Our responsibility</h3>
    <p>We work hard to ensure everything on GetYourWorm is accurate and up to date. That said, we don’t guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or relevance of any information on the site.</p>
    <p>We’re not liable for any loss or damage that may result from your use of the site or any decisions made based on the information here.</p>

    <h3>4. External links</h3>
    <p>Sometimes we link to other websites we think might be useful or interesting. We’re not responsible for the content, accuracy, or privacy practices of those sites — they’re outside of our control.</p>

    <h3>5. Intellectual property</h3>
    <p>All content, design, branding, and tools on GetYourWorm are the property of GetYourWorm (unless otherwise stated). Please don’t copy or reuse our stuff without permission.</p>

    <h3>6. Changes to the site or terms</h3>
    <p>We may update the site or these Terms & Conditions from time to time. Changes will take effect as soon as they’re published here, so we recommend checking back occasionally.</p>
